`Generate (week)` ensures:

1. Everybody is assigned at least once
2. There are no consecutive days where a person is assigned.
      - This is only enforced if there are at least 8 people.
3. A person cannot be Lead more than once
      - This is only enforced if there are at least 5 people.
4. Office Days (Tues and Thurs) have no response, because everybody is responding.
